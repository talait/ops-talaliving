-- 0019_acct_review.sql — the exception road, and the bank's own record.
--
-- Two tables that look unrelated and are the same idea: **evidence arriving
-- before the row it belongs to.**
--
-- `evidence_inbox` is the exception road (ADR-010, D94). Everything with a
-- known parent is attached from the record — somebody opens the PR line or the
-- ledger row and files it there. This is for the rest: a photo sent to chat at
-- nine at night with no context. Five roads out, **none of which delete**, and
-- the count is watched, because if it grows people are routing around the
-- normal road and the reason is worth finding.
--
-- `bank_statements` is the opposite case and the reason M31 exists. For the two
-- leadership accounts a statement is not a check on rows somebody typed — it is
-- **the only way their rows exist at all** (D180). Nobody enters those
-- transactions; the statement is the source.

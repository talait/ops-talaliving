# Run every smoke file against the throwaway cluster.
#
# The definition of done in `docs/plan/phase-2/README.md` asks each schema for a
# smoke that proves at least one **refusal** and one **derivation** — a policy
# that says no, and a view that computes what the demo computed. Refusals are
# the half that rots silently: a view that breaks returns a wrong number
# somebody eventually notices, a policy that stops refusing returns the right
# number to the wrong person and nothing looks unusual at all.
#
# So they are files, one per schema, run together:
#
#   supabase/local/smoke.sh
#   PGHOST=/tmp PGPORT=5433 supabase/local/smoke.sh
#   PGHOST=/tmp PGPORT=5433 supabase/local/smoke.sh 02_core_auth
#
# Every file wraps itself in begin/rollback, so the cluster is unchanged
# afterwards and the order they run in cannot matter. Each one is also runnable
# on its own with plain `psql -f`, which is what you want at 7pm when only one
# of them is failing.

# Before any assertion: the static check.
#
# A PL/pgSQL local sharing a name with a column makes every query below it
# ambiguous, and Postgres refuses **at run time** — so the migration applies,
# the function is created, and the failure waits for whichever branch reaches
# that line. Five of those in one session is not five mistakes, it is a missing
# check, so it runs here where nobody has to remember it.

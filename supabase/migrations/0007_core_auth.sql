-- 0007_core_auth.sql — B5. Who is asking, according to Supabase Auth.
--
-- `0002` built the grant tables and the two functions every policy calls, but
-- it left the row in `core.users` to be conjured by somebody. This migration
-- closes that: signing in **provisions**, granting is an audited seam, and
-- `actAs` — the demo's persona picker — has nowhere left to land.
--
-- The order in `03-estimate.md` puts this first for a reason worth repeating:
-- every refusal in every other schema is theatre until the database knows who
-- is asking. A policy that reads `auth.uid()` when `auth.uid()` is always the
-- same developer proves nothing at all.

-- ── provisioning ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- A person exists in two places: `auth.users`, which Supabase owns and which
-- holds the password and the session, and `core.users`, which we own and which
-- holds the name, the grants and the trail. The second must never be created by
-- hand — a sign-in that finds no profile row is a user who can authenticate and
-- do nothing, and the support call that follows is unanswerable.
--
-- **Nobody arrives with access.** A new row gets zero modules and zero
-- authorities, and somebody holding `it.manage_roles` grants them. That is the
-- opposite of the old system, where a new account inherited whatever the role
-- string implied, and it is the reason a leaver is a `left_on` date rather than
-- a deletion (A5).

--
-- Called by `src/lib/api/identity.ts` after Supabase returns a session. It is
-- deliberately not a trigger on `auth.sessions`: that table is Supabase's, and
-- hanging our audit off somebody else's schema is a thing that breaks silently
-- on their upgrade.

-- (rule 3) — a grant with no audit row is a grant nobody can account for.
--
-- The refusals are the point of the file:
--
--   1. `it.manage_roles` or 403. A module level never implies it (D24).
--   2. **Never self-service**, even holding the permission. Somebody who can
--      raise their own authorities is somebody with every authority, and the
--      fact that they had to ask a second person is the whole control.
--
-- Both are written as a replace of the whole set rather than add/remove verbs:
-- the screen shows a list of checkboxes and saves it, and two verbs would make
-- "what does this person hold" a question about the order of the calls.

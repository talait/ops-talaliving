-- Pulled ahead of procurement's views on purpose. `v_pr_line_status` cannot
-- compute whether a line is PAID without the allocations against it and the VOID
-- status of the transaction behind each one — "a stamp pointing at nothing is
-- not paid" (A10). Written in layer order, procurement's central view would have
-- been unrunnable, and therefore unreviewed, until nine migrations later. The
-- reasoning is in `01-schema.md` under *Per schema, not per layer*.
--
-- This is `acct`'s spine, not the whole of it: the review inbox and the cash
-- calendar are their own migrations, later, and they are nobody's dependency.

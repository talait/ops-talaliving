-- 0018_procure_detail_views.sql — the two views a drawer opens with.
--
-- `PoDetail` and `PrDocumentView` in `src/services/procurement/contracts.ts`
-- are deliberately fat: *"a drawer that needs three calls is a drawer that
-- renders in three stages"*. Assembling them client-side would mean three
-- round trips, three loading states, and three chances for one of them to fail
-- and leave the drawer half-drawn.
--
-- So they are assembled here, in one row each, with the nested parts as jsonb.
-- That is not a convenience: it is the same rule as everywhere else — the
-- figure and the thing it is derived from are computed together, once, so they
-- cannot disagree.

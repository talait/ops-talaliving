/** Two rekening koran, and every situation a reconciliation actually meets
 *  (D180).
 *
 *  **BCA 064** — the leadership rupiah account. Most of its lines already have
 *  a ledger row, because somebody typed the transfers as they made them; two
 *  do not, and those are the ones the statement exists to catch. One is a bank
 *  charge nobody would ever have entered by hand.
 *
 *  **BCA USD 081** — three lines in dollars and **no rate on any of them**.
 *  Nothing can reach the ledger until a person types what the bank actually
 *  gave them that day (D181). The screen says so rather than converting at a
 *  rate the system invented.

-- 0008_procure_pr.sql — the request chain: documents, lines, approvals, notes,
-- and the variance that is a row rather than a note.
--
-- The shape here follows one redefinition, and everything else falls out of it:
-- **the ITEM is what everyone tracks** (D48). A document is a submission batch —
-- these lines arrived together, on a day, from a person — and carries no
-- purpose of its own, because a request can hold items for three jobs from
-- three suppliers and a single "purpose" on the container would be a lie about
-- at least two of them.
--
-- A line then stays on the board until it is settled or no longer needed, so
-- "it comes back at the next leadership meeting" needs no machinery at all. The
-- old system moved unpaid lines into a fresh document to make them reappear;
-- that existed because the surface was a spreadsheet with one tab per
-- submission, and there is nothing here to carry forward.

/** A fresh sandbox. `Reset demo data` rebuilds from here, so this function

/** A fingerprint of the shape and the reference data.
 *
 *  The sandbox is kept in `localStorage`, and a saved snapshot from before a
 *  change quietly wins over the fixtures — which is how a newly added account
 *  can be in the code and absent from the screen (F24). Anything that changes
 *  the tables, the accounts or the people invalidates what is stored, so the
 *  demo starts from the fixtures again rather than from a shape that no longer
 *  exists.
 */

 *  hide. Counting rows cannot do this job: a visitor who records one delivery
 *  changes every count, and their own work is exactly what the snapshot is
 *  for. A version somebody types when they edit the fixtures separates "the
 *  demo data moved" from "somebody used the demo". */

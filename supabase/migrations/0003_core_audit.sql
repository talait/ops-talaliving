-- one audit row, one outbox row. All three or none (03-api.md). The audit row
-- carries **what changed**, field by field — "who touched the ledger this
-- month" is not the question anybody asks; "what happened to *this* row" is,
-- and it is asked while looking at it (D84).

-- ── the envelope, in SQL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- `03-api.md` rule 4: **refusals are values, not exceptions.** Every seam in
-- this database returns one of the shapes below, and `src/lib/api/_kit.ts`
-- turns it into the same `Result<T>` the screens already handle.
--
-- It is not only a style choice, and the reason is worth writing down because
-- it was found the hard way. A seam that refuses by `raise exception` **rolls
-- back its own audit row**: the write_audit call and the raise are in one
-- transaction, so the trail of the refusal disappears with the refusal. A7 says
-- a refusal is recorded, not silent — and implemented as an exception it is
-- silent by construction, whatever the code appears to say.
--
-- So every wrapper here writes the trail *and* returns the answer, which makes
-- "record the refusal" impossible to forget rather than merely required. The
-- statuses match `src/services/_shared/envelope.ts` exactly:
--
--   ok        200  outcome ok
--   noop      200  outcome noop       nothing needed doing
--   refused   403  outcome refused    signed in, but this decision is not yours
--   invalid   422  outcome refused    the values are wrong
--   conflict  409  outcome duplicate  already decided; the client KEEPS its claim
--   not_found 404  outcome refused

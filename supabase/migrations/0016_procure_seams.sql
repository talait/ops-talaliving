-- 0016_procure_seams.sql — the write functions.
--
-- `02-api.md` says which of the 65 procurement functions land as a view, which
-- as an RPC and which as a handler, and the rule for choosing is short: **a
-- seam that is only a table insert loses the audit row and the refusal** (D84).
-- Everything here writes at least three things in one transaction — the
-- business rows, one `core.audit_log` row, one `core.outbox` row — and all
-- three or none.
--
-- Every one of them returns an envelope rather than raising, for the reason set
-- out in `0003`: a refusal implemented as an exception rolls back its own audit
-- row, and A7 becomes a comment. `core.refused(...)` writes the trail and
-- returns the answer in one call, so recording a refusal is not something a
-- seam can forget to do.
--
-- They are `security definer` because they write `core.audit_log` and
-- `core.outbox`, which no client may write directly. That means **each one
-- checks its own authority**: definer turns the policy off, so the guard the
-- policy would have applied has to be here, in the open, at the top of the
-- function where a reviewer reads it first.

-- Who is acting, by email, for the trail. A seam that recorded only a uuid
-- would leave every approval readable solely by joining, and a trail nobody can
-- read is a trail nobody checks (ADR-004).

# Findings — what building the workflow taught us

**This file is the deliverable of Phase 1, as much as the app is.**

The premise of the whole plan is that the business rules were never specified
up front, and that you find them by walking a working screen rather than by
designing a schema. This is where what we find gets written down. On D14 it
is consolidated, and `02-database.md` is rewritten against it.

Append one entry per session. Never edit an old entry — if a finding turns out
to be wrong, add a new entry saying so.

## Entry format

```
## D4 · 2026-09-13 · M4 PR list and create

**What the screen could not answer.**
…a question a real user asked that the data does not hold.

**What we assumed.**
…the default taken, and from where (06-decisions Qn, or new).

**What this implies for the schema.**
…the field, table, state or rule that turns out to be needed.

**What surprised us.**
…anything that contradicts a document or an assumption.
```

Keep entries short. Four lines each is fine. What matters is that they exist
and that nothing gets remembered only in a chat log.

## F1 · 2026-09-10 · before any code — the direction of evidence

**What the owner said.** Today: upload to Google Chat, then review on the
web. "That's really hard to trace between the existing data because it's
unordered." Instead: accounting attaches documents **directly from the PR, or
from the ledger**. A context-free upload is only for the case where there is
no PR — bought first, approved later. Google Chat becomes notification,
confirmation, and the interface for people outside web access. A reader bot
already exists; integration is later.

**Why "unordered" is the right word.** In the current model every document is
an orphan looking for a parent. The extraction guesses a vendor and an amount,
and a person reconstructs the linkage afterwards from name similarity and
amount proximity. Nothing records *who decided* that this receipt belongs to
that line — only that someone once picked it off a list. That is what makes
it untraceable, and it is not fixed by improving the guess.

**What this implies for the schema.**

- `core.attachment_links` moves from a convenience to **the main road**, and
  many-to-many stops being a workaround for unnameable files.
- Every link row must carry **who declared it and when**. That single column
  is the answer to the tracing problem.
- The review queue shrinks to `acct.evidence_inbox` and loses everything that
  existed to support the guess: slot naming, the capped candidate picker, the
  always-offer-the-selected-line rule, `duplicate_of_event`.
- It gains `origin` (`chat` | `web`) and a health view, because the size of
  the exception road is now a signal about the health of the normal one.
- A new resolution appears that the old model had no name for: **a retroactive
  PR line**. Purchase-first-approval-later has a legitimate shape, and giving
  it one keeps it out of the off-PR bucket.

**Two of the four questions dissolve; two are real.** "Which PR?" and "is this
supporting an existing transaction?" are answered by construction once the
person attaches from the parent. "One document, many transactions" and "one PR
line, many transactions" survive — the first becomes an explicit *also
covers…* action, the second was already the allocation model.

**What surprised us.** The AI's job gets smaller and safer. On the main road
the vendor, the expected amount and the parent are already known, so
extraction stops classifying and starts **verifying** — and a disagreement
becomes an advisory warning rather than something a human has to adjudicate
before anything can be recorded.

**Assumptions taken** (see `06-decisions.md`): the exception upload arrives
from Chat *and* the web and lands in the same inbox (Q-none, inferred — the
buyer without web access is precisely the exception case); Chat approvals
cover goods and receiving but not fund decisions (Q16); attaching a payment
proof to a line with no transaction offers to post one in the same panel
(Q14).


## F2 · 2026-09-11 · before any code — five answers, and what they moved

**Answered.** PR approval is the CEO's alone (Q2). The ledger is visible to
whoever has accounting-module access, and a user holds several accesses at
once (Q3). The IT gate is gone and there is no urgency field — every requested
line stays in the queue until it is approved, rejected or withdrawn (Q4).
Service lines complete on payment proof, and auto-complete stays manual for
now (Q9). The Vercel URL is enough (Q12).

**What moved beyond the questions asked.**

Q3 is not really about the ledger. "A user can have multiple access like
procurement + Accounting + HRD" replaces a single-role session with a set of
grants, which changes `src/store/session.tsx`, the topbar control, and how
`can()` resolves. The demo gets better for it: a grant picker demonstrates
permissions far more convincingly than a dropdown.

Q2 and Q3 together forced a split we had not made: **module access and
authority are different things**. Access says which screens open; authority
says which decisions you may take. Keeping them fused is exactly the bug
`john-lau` has — the confirm button showed for three roles and the bridge then
refused it from an environment variable the screen could not read. Four
authorities now: `approve_goods`, `approve_funds`, `post_ledger`,
`resolve_inbox`.

**A tension that resolved itself.** `john-lau` fused accounting and
procurement into one role on purpose, so nobody could approve a purchase
without seeing the cash. Composable grants would have reopened that — except
CEO-only approval takes purchase approval out of the module system entirely.
The safeguard is no longer needed in that shape.

**A word that needed a definition.** Q4 says a line stays until "removed or
approved". *Removed* had no meaning in the model, so it now has one: the
requester withdraws their own line before any decision, softly, with a name
and a timestamp. After a decision the only exit is a rejection (Q17).

**What surprised us.** Dropping urgency makes the queue simpler, not poorer.
A queue that shows every outstanding line at once needs no priority column —
the CEO is reading the whole list either way. The rekap's whole apparatus of
daily digests, 48-hour re-pings and 72-hour escalations existed to work around
a queue nobody could see in full.

**Three new questions**, each with a default so nothing blocks: who may
withdraw and until when (Q17), what happens when the CEO is away (Q18), and
whether `HOLD` survives without a digest to reappear in (Q19). Q18 is the one
worth a real answer before somebody is on a plane.

## F3 · 2026-09-11 · before any code — approval becomes a checkbox

**Answered.** No substitute for the CEO; a co-CEO grant can come later (Q18).
A line is removed because it is no longer needed — no deadline, nothing ages
out (Q17). **Approval is a checkbox: approved or not, no other status** (Q19).
Attaching a payment proof to a line with no transaction offers to post one
(Q14). Chat approvals cover goods and receiving, not money (Q16).

**Q19 is the structural one.** The line status ladder drops from nine values
to eight, and two of the old ones disappear together: `HELD` and `REJECTED`.

What is striking is that **nothing is lost**. `HELD` meant "seen, not decided,
comes back" — an unchecked line does exactly that, because the queue is now a
standing list of everything outstanding (D21). `REJECTED` meant "can never be
paid" — a removed line carries the same guarantee. The middle state existed
because the spreadsheet had *both* a checkbox and a status column, and someone
had to reconcile them. With one surface there is one fact.

**Where the nuance went.** Into the audit trail rather than the vocabulary.
Every toggle writes an append-only row with time, name, email and channel, so
"approved at 14:02, un-approved at 14:09, approved again at 16:30" is fully
legible — which the old three-value column could not express at all. The
screen gets simpler and the record gets richer, which is the right direction.

**A word that needed a guard.** "Removed because we no longer need it" is
open-ended by design, and mostly that is fine. But it cannot stay open-ended
once money has moved: a line with an allocation against it is not something
you stop needing, it is something you return, credit, or void. So removal is
refused past that point (D29) — the one place the owner's "no deadline" needs
a boundary that is not a deadline.

**One fork we defaulted rather than decided** (Q20): the checkbox is the
*status*, but the approved *amount* is a separate field. We kept the ability
to reduce it before checking, because that is how "approve two of the five"
works and it is what A8 exists to protect. Removing it would mean the CEO can
only accept in full or remove — a real business change, and one worth making
deliberately if that is what "no other status" was meant to imply.

**What surprised us.** Three of the five answers this round simplify the model
rather than extend it. The system being replaced accumulated states because
several surfaces each needed their own; with one surface, most of them turn
out to be the same two facts wearing different names.

## F4 · 2026-09-11 · M1 — what building the demo layer taught us

**What the screen could not answer.** Nothing yet; M1 has no product screens.
But writing `derive.ts` forced five rules to become precise that had been
prose, and precision found problems.

**1. A PR line that funds a PO deposit can never be COMPLETED on its own.**
It reaches PAID and stops. Delivery arrives against the purchase order, whose
two axes carry it — and folding that back into the PR line would be exactly
the collapse A1 forbids. The fixture originally pointed such a line at a
`po_line_id`, which made it complete as soon as that one PO row was delivered:
wrong, and only visible once the status was computed rather than described.

**2. Coverage has to exclude voided transactions, or a voided payment leaves
its line looking paid.** "A stamp pointing at nothing is not paid" turns out
to be a join condition, not a slogan.

**3. The coverage fallback is load-bearing.** An unapproved line has no
approved amount, so it must be measured against what was *asked* — otherwise
its approved total is zero, zero is covered, and the line reads as settled.
The old system has the same fallback and the same comment about it.

**4. PARTIAL sits above PAID in the ladder, deliberately.** A line that is
fully paid but only half received reads PARTIAL. Money is the less interesting
fact once goods are in question, and the reader needs the goods answer first.

**5. The fixtures caught a modelling truth by being wrong.** BNI 325 went
negative, because payroll leaves that account and nothing ever funded it. The
fix was not a bigger opening balance but the missing transfers — money has to
reach an account before it can leave. The recap treats a negative balance as a
row in the wrong place; here it was a row that did not exist.

**What surprised us.** The refusals were the easiest part to get right and the
most valuable to have. Six of them are now exercised on page load — approving
above what was requested, approving without the authority, removing a line
money has reached, over-allocating a transaction, replaying an idempotency
key, allocating to a PR line that does not exist — and each one is a rule from
`00-context.md` proved rather than asserted. Building them first means no
screen can be written optimistic.

**One concept with no Phase 2 equivalent:** `identity.actAs()`. It exists only
so permissions can be demonstrated, and it is a clean marker of exactly what
gets deleted when the demo layer goes.

**Still open.** Q20 — whether the CEO may still approve part of a line — is
implemented as "yes, the amount may be reduced before checking", because that
is the default we recorded. If the answer is no, `approveLine` loses its
`approved_amount` argument and the change is small; it gets larger once the
approval screen is built on D5.

-- 0015_core_idempotency.sql — a repeat is one decision, not two.
--
-- Pulled a long way forward from the plan's `0027`, and the reason is the same
-- one that moved `acct_ledger`: a seam written without this has to be opened
-- again and threaded through, and a seam opened twice is one whose audit and
-- outbox rows get rearranged by somebody who has forgotten why they were in
-- that order.
--
-- The failure this prevents is concrete and has happened three times in this
-- project's history: a double tap on a slow phone becoming two approvals, or
-- two payments. The UI makes the key when a **form opens**, not when it is
-- submitted, so both taps carry the same key and the second one is answered
-- with the first one's answer.
--
-- **What is stored and what is not** is rule 4 of `03-api.md`, and it is the
-- subtle half:
--
--   ok, noop, 409   stored. The thing happened (or had already happened), so a
--                   repeat must return the same answer and change nothing.
--   403, 422, 5xx   NOT stored — the claim is released. The caller is expected
--                   to grant the authority, fix the value or try again, and
--                   they will reuse the key when they do. Storing a 422 would
--                   make a corrected resubmission return the old complaint for
--                   ever, which is a bug that looks exactly like the validation
--                   being wrong.

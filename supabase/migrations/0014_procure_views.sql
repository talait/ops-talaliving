-- 0014_procure_views.sql — every derived fact in procurement, computed on read.
--
-- This file is the port of `src/demo/derive.ts`, and it is the migration that
-- decides whether the swap is honest. The demo computes these numbers in
-- TypeScript, in a browser, from fixtures; the screens have been read against
-- them for 26 milestones and the owner has argued about several of them by
-- name. **The view has to produce the same number, or the swap is a rewrite
-- wearing the same function signatures.**
--
-- Two rules for the port, both learned in Phase 1:
--
--   * **A view may return a missing figure. It may not return a wrong one.**
--     Where the demo marks a total incomplete, the view returns null plus a
--     count — never a silent zero.
--   * **Port the test with the logic.** `smoke/03_procure.sql` reproduces
--     numbers this project has already argued about.
--
-- Nothing here is stored. Status, coverage, the meeting quadrant, the variance,
-- what a vendor could invoice today — all of it is computed from the rows, every
-- time, because a stored status is one that disagrees with the rows behind it
-- (A3). That is also why these views are long: the arithmetic has to live
-- somewhere, and the alternative is a column somebody has to remember to update.

-- ── the current decision ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Approval is append-only (D28), so the current answer is the latest row.
-- `distinct on` with an explicit tiebreak: two approvals can share a timestamp
-- when a batch is answered in one transaction, and without the id in the sort a
-- tie would resolve differently between two runs of the same query.

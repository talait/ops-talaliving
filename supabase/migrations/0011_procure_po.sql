-- 0011_procure_po.sql — the order as an obligation.
--
-- A purchase order is a promise to a supplier **in the company's name**, and
-- everything in this file follows from taking that literally:
--
--   * it is confirmed before it is sent, not after (D132);
--   * once issued it only moves by **supersession**, because the vendor is
--     holding a piece of paper and two pieces of paper have to be tellable
--     apart (D135);
--   * what was paid and what arrived are computed apart and **stay apart** —
--     an order can be fully paid and empty, or full and unpaid, and one
--     progress bar says neither (A1).
--
-- That last one is why `po_status_t` lost its `PARTIAL`: delivery is an axis,
-- not a lifecycle stage, and it is derived in `v_po_status` (0014).

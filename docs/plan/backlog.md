# Backlog — reported, not yet built

Things somebody noticed while using the demo, kept here so they are neither
lost nor silently promoted above the work in hand. Each one says what was
observed, not what to build — the fix is decided when it is picked up.

Fixed items stay, struck through, with the commit that closed them. A backlog
that only shows what is left teaches nobody anything.

## Bugs

| # | What happens | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | ~~Clicking into the instruction box opens the line drawer behind it and takes the focus with it~~ | `/procurement/meeting` | **fixed** 2026-09-11 — the cell stops the row's click (F36) |
| B2 | ~~The evidence chips — *photo of the goods*, *tanda terima*, *on file* — read as labels and cannot be opened~~ | `/procurement/tracker/[vendor]` | **fixed** 2026-09-13 (M55) — D268. The booleans behind them became attachment ids, so presence is derived from the thing itself; one `EvidenceChip` for all three. It found a mislabelled file on its first use (F88) |
| B3 | ~~An image has to be opened through a button before it can be seen. Every picture in the queue should show its own preview~~ | `/accounting/verifikasi` | **fixed** 2026-09-12 (M39) — a preview on the selected document and on every decided one, swapping in place rather than opening a modal. What it draws is a stand-in that says so on its face (D208); Phase 2 puts the file in the same slot |
| B4 | ~~**Already decided** grows without limit and pushes the queue off the screen~~ | `/accounting/verifikasi` | **fixed** — paging 2026-09-12 (M26, D157); the date window 2026-09-13 (M55, D269). Ninety days by default, and the card always says how many decisions are outside the window and names the oldest, because a list that quietly stops somewhere lies by omission |

## Scheduled — the owner's answers of 2026-09-11

| # | What | Note |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | ~~**Stock: materials and hardware, properly categorised**~~ | **built 2026-09-11 (M27)**, D169–D172; **the other half of Q40 closed 2026-09-13 (M54)**, D266. Confirming a receipt stocks the goods; issuing draws them down against the SPK, from a list the BOM proposes and a person confirms. Nothing deducts automatically, and that is the decision rather than an omission |
| S2 | ~~**Berkas 201 and Cuti & Izin**~~ | **built 2026-09-11 (M29)** — D177, D178. Compliance removed from the menu |
| S3 | ~~**Desain, for the drafters**~~ | **built 2026-09-11 (M30)** — `/produksi/desain`, D179 |
| S4 | ~~**Pay schemes as configuration**~~ | **built 2026-09-11 (M28)** — `/it/aturan-gaji`, D173–D176. Overtime now follows the national ladder (Q31 answered); undertime is built and off by default |
| S5 | ~~**Rekening koran upload for the leadership accounts**~~ | **built 2026-09-11 (M31)** — `/accounting/rekening-koran`, D180–D182. Q42 answered: the statement is the only road, and the USD rate is typed per line |
| S6 | ~~**Package: the agent-commission programme**~~ | **built 2026-09-12 (M32)** — `/marketing/pipeline` and `/marketing/agen`, D183–D186, from the owner's own pipeline dashboard as the reference |

## Placeholder screens — routes that exist and hold nothing

**A placeholder is a finding, not a file** (F54). A route created to hold a
place goes on this list in the same commit, because the menu is the only other
record that it is empty and the menu is what makes it look full.

| Route | What it should hold | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `/it/audit` · `/it/aktivitas` · `/it/pengguna` · `/it/peran` | ~~the two trails, the grants, the catalogue~~ | **built 2026-09-12 (M34)** — they were placeholders for thirty-one milestones and nothing in the build could say so (F54) |
| ~~`/proyek/pengiriman`~~ | ~~delivery of finished goods to the site~~ | **built 2026-09-13 (M40)** — D209–D212 |
| ~~`/proyek/instalasi`~~ | ~~installation on site, and what it found~~ | **built 2026-09-13 (M40)** — D209–D212 |
| ~~`/proyek/serah-terima`~~ | ~~handover, and what the client signed~~ | **built 2026-09-13 (M40)** — D209–D212 |
| ~~`/pengaturan`~~ | ~~the settings that are today constants in `src/lib/`~~ | **built 2026-09-13 (M42)** — D214–D216. **The placeholder list is now empty.** |
| ~~`/accounting/payslip`~~ | ~~nothing — it duplicates `/hrd/payroll`~~ | **removed** 2026-09-13 (M41) — owner: accounting does not read payslips. Deleted rather than parked: D105 parked two *working* screens over a judgement that might change; this was an empty route, and the question it was holding open has been answered (D213) |

## From the interview of 2026-09-13 — answered, deliberately not built yet

Nineteen questions were answered in one conversation (D227–D249). Five were
small enough to ship in the same commit. **These are the rest**, kept here
rather than in the open-questions table because they are no longer questions —
the decision is made and only the build is outstanding. Numbered as the owner
and I numbered them while agreeing what to do first.

| # | What was decided | Size | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| #6 | ~~**The pay model splits into pokok + tunjangan**, with the hourly divisor derived from *setahun gaji ÷ hari kerja efektif ÷ jam sehari* rather than 173~~ | large | **built 2026-09-13 (M46)** — D250, D251, D252. The seeded split moves nobody's total at full attendance; what it moves is what a missed day costs. Lateness ships computed and not applied. Four findings fell out (F70–F73) |
| #7 | ~~**Simplify the production stages, and add a subcontract route**~~ | medium | **built 2026-09-13 (M47)** — D253, D254, D255. Seven stages became four; the route is a list of stages, so what a subcontracted order does *not* have is as visible as what it does. Two findings (F74, F75) |
| #8 | ~~**Version the bill of material**, pinned to the work order that used it~~ | medium | **built 2026-09-13 (M48)** — D256. Every pre-existing BOM became rev 1, released, which loses nothing: it was the only list that had ever existed. Two findings (F76, F77) |
| #9 | ~~**Layered BOM, a button that raises a PR from one, and a typed labour cost**~~ | large | **built 2026-09-13 (M49)** — D257, D239, and D258 for the self-check the work exposed. The button existed since M23 and was quietly dropping every sub-assembly (F78) |
| #10b | ~~**BPJS and PPh: the enrolment register, and the per-person reconciliation**~~ | medium | **built 2026-09-13 (M50)** — D259. PPh 21 is recorded and not computed, which is the honest half. One finding (F80) and one new question (Q49) |
| #11 | ~~**KPI analyzer and task tracker**, with lateness as one of the points~~ | large | **built 2026-09-13 (M51)** — D260, D261. One finding in three parts (F81). Two things it deliberately does not do: score production work, and score overtime |
| #12 | ~~**QR per box for installation** (W4)~~ | large | **built 2026-09-13 (M52)** — D262, D263. The half of #12 that was never waiting on anything: the person scanning a box is our own installer, who has a login (F82). The vendor-PO half (W3) is still Phase 2 |

## Open, from building #6

| # | Question | Why it is a question and not a default |
|---|---|---|
| Q44 | ~~**One business, two schedules, one start time.**~~ | **answered 2026-09-13** — produksi 07.30, kantor 08.00, istirahat 45 menit (D270). Built: the start time is a map per unit in the dated rule book, the correction is dated to the version it corrects, and the break is reported and never deducted. Two findings (F89, F90) |
| Q45 | ~~**What is this business's own `hari kerja efektif`?**~~ | **answered 2026-09-13** — IT types the yearly figure, HRD and payroll read it, and the monthly average is **derived** from it rather than stored beside it (D271). The access split was already what the screen did; the division is the new part |
| Q49 | **What is this business's BPJS risk class?** It sets the JKK rate, between 0,24% and 1,74%, and BPJS assigns it per employer | Raised 2026-09-13 (D259). Every other percentage here is published and citable; this one is not, so the seed carries a class-II stand-in of 0,54% marked `confirmed: false` and the screen says so. **A rate nobody has checked must not look like one that has been** — and the difference between 0,24% and 1,74% is seven times the money |
| Q50 | **Which PTKP bracket is each person in, and does the business want PPh 21 computed here at all?** | Raised 2026-09-13 (D259). The register records who has an NPWP; the calculation is not built. PPh 21 is progressive over TER tables that change, and getting it wrong is the deduction an employee notices. Worth asking whether it belongs in this system or with whoever files the SPT |
| Q47 | **Are these the right four stages, and is *amplas* really part of Finishing?** Pembuatan · Finishing · QC · Packing, with potong/serut/rakit inside the first and amplas inside the second | Raised 2026-09-13 (D253). The owner said *sederhanakan*; he did not name the four. The collapse is our reading, it is a **seed edit** to change, and the workshop's own words for what happens inside each stage are printed on the board so the reading is visible rather than buried |
| Q48 | ~~**Does a subcontracted piece ever come back needing more than finishing?**~~ | **answered 2026-09-13 by replacing the question** (D273) — *pernah, seperti amplas ulang, tapi abaikan saja*. The real case is bigger: several vendors each doing one process (barang mentah, jok, amplas, packing) and a piece that can visit more than one. Not a third route; a new shape, raised as **W6** |
| Q46 | ~~**Does a company half day earn the full tunjangan?**~~ | **answered 2026-09-13** — *tunjangan penuh kecuali HR mengabaikan* (D272). The behaviour was already this; what changed is that it is now a ruling rather than our reading of one |

| W6 | **Track which vendor did which process to which item** — the business has vendors for raw goods, jok, amplas and packing, and a piece can visit more than one of them. The current work order holds a single `subcon_sent_on` / `subcon_returned_on` pair, which cannot describe two legs, let alone say which vendor had it for which process | Raised 2026-09-13 (D273), from the owner's answer to Q48. Deliberately **not** a third route on `ROUTES`: routes describe the stages a piece goes through in-house, and this is about who held the piece and when. Needs its own record — item × process × vendor, each leg with its own dates — and it is what makes *where is my chair* answerable when the answer is *at the upholsterer since Tuesday* |
| W5 | ~~**Link production work to people.**~~ — **built 2026-09-13 (M53)**, D264. An optional `employee_id` beside the name, resolved once per name by a person; the software suggests and never matches. Production work is now shown on the KPI card as the *deliverable* half and still deliberately not scored, because a piece is not a unit |

## Asked for, not yet scheduled

| # | What | Note |
|---|---|---|
| W2 | ~~**Two roads to a confirmed PO**~~ | **built 2026-09-13 (M55)** — D267. Leadership writing their own order confirms it in the same act, recorded as `self_confirmed` and said plainly on the banner; anybody else's order goes out as a chat card answered from the approver's own account, refused from anybody else's (D69's rule, one level up) |
| W3 | **The PDF a vendor receives should carry its own signature** — answered: a **QR resolving to our own PO page** (D244). Still Phase 2: a vendor has no account here, so it needs a public read route and a token scoped per order. The PO screen now renders the QR **inside the app** with a note saying exactly that, and it is deliberately not printed on the vendor's PDF — a QR that fails for the person holding it is worse than no QR | Raised 2026-09-11, answered 2026-09-13. The two other candidates are dead: a scanned signature survives a photocopier and therefore proves nothing, a cryptographic one nobody in this trade can verify. The QR also catches an amended order presented as the original, because what the vendor sees is live |
| W4 | ~~**QR per box, as the marker for installation**~~ — **built 2026-09-13 (M52)**, D262/D263 — the owner's second sentence on Q29, and a different thing from W3 | Raised 2026-09-13 (D244). A purchase order is one document with one QR; an installation needs a code **per box** that survives being carried to a site, and resolves to what is inside it and where it goes. Not built by widening W3 |
| W1 | ~~Receiving reported by whoever actually saw the goods arrive~~ | **answered and built** 2026-09-11 (D131). The owner's answer changed the shape: there *is* a procurement team with access, so accountability was never in doubt — the problem is only that goods arrive outside working hours. So receiving split into a report (photo, anyone present) and a confirmation (tanda terima, procurement). The Chat route is no longer required for it: the same two acts work from the app tonight, and a bot can produce the report later without changing anything |

# Not a deployment script — it exists so a change to a migration can be proved

#
# This script begins with six `drop schema … cascade`, and `00_shim.sql` begins
# with a seventh: `drop schema auth cascade`. Against the wrong database either
# one is unrecoverable, and the wrong database is one environment variable away.
# So:
#
#   1. **It refuses any host that is not local.** `PGHOST=db.xxx.supabase.co`
#      is not a mistake this script is willing to let somebody make at 7pm. A
#      remote database is reached by a migration tool, reviewed, one file at a
#      time — never by a thing whose first act is to drop six schemas.
#
#   2. **It never runs the shim where a real `auth` schema exists.** The shim
#      fakes just enough of Supabase for the migrations to run on a bare
#      Postgres. Where Supabase is actually present — the local stack, or a
#      hosted project — `auth` belongs to GoTrue and holds the passwords. The
#      shim would drop it, and every account with it.

# The schema, table by table, in the order it has to be built

`02-database.md` is the reasoning — why a tap is a row, why an approval carries
the identity that answered it, why a variance is a row and not a note. This
file is the **build order**, and it is the only place the ladder is complete
and current as of M26.

Everything here is derived from `src/services/*/contracts.ts` and
`src/demo/state.ts`, which are the running shape — not from an earlier plan.

---

## Conventions, applied to every table without restating them

| Rule | How it looks |
|---|---|
| Primary key | `uuid … default gen_random_uuid()` |
| Public identity | a `*_no` / `code` text column, unique, minted by `core.next_doc_number()` (ADR-005) |
| Time | `timestamptz`, always. Dates that mean an office day are `date` and computed with `core.office_day()` (F17) |
| Money | `numeric`, whole rupiah. Never `float` |
| Deletion | none. No `DELETE` policy and no `DELETE` grant. Supersession, VOID, `left_on`, `merged_into`, `unlinked_at` (A2, A5) |
| Audit | every write seam calls `core.write_audit(…)` and `core.emit(…)` in the same transaction |
| RLS | on for every table. Read on `module.read`, write on `module.create` / `module.update`, decisions on `core.has_authority(…)` |
| Cross-schema references | by public code as `text`, never a foreign key across a service seam (ADR-004) |

The pattern is written out once, in `0006_procure_reference.sql`. Every later
migration repeats it; where one deviates, the deviation carries a comment
saying why.

## The ladder

`0001`–`0006` exist and apply. The rest are specified here and not yet written.

| # | File | Tables | Notes that decide the shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0001 | `core_types` | — | every enum, all six schemas. **Done**, and **corrected at B1** — see *Enums the contracts corrected* below |
| 0002 | `core_identity` | `users`, `user_modules`, `user_authorities`, `permission_catalog`, `v_my_access` | `has_permission()` / `has_authority()` — the only two functions a policy calls. **Done** |
| 0003 | `core_audit` | `audit_log`, `outbox`, `settings` | `write_audit()`, `emit()`. **Done** |
| 0004 | `core_numbers` | `doc_numbers`, `doc_prefixes` | `next_doc_number()`, ten prefixes. **Done** |
| 0005 | `core_files` | `attachments`, `attachment_links`, `doc_kind_labels` | file **or** link (D125); unlink is an update. **Done** |
| 0006 | `procure_reference` | `vendors`, `uom`, `uom_conversions`, `item_categories`, `items`, `projects`, `project_lines` | merge is a pointer; uncurated rows are allowed in (D30–D33). **Done**, and the units, conversions and categories are now **seeded** — they are foreign keys, so without them nothing could be inserted into the schema at all |
| 0007 | `core_auth` | — | **B5. Done.** Provisioning on sign-up, the sign-in trail, `set_modules()` / `set_authorities()`, `v_user_access`, `bootstrap_admin()`. `actAs` has nowhere to land |
| 0008 | `procure_pr` | `pr_documents`, `pr_lines`, `pr_approvals`, `line_notes`, `line_variances` | an approval carries **who answered and through which door** (F16, D19); a revision supersedes, never edits (A2); a variance is a row (F13, D98) |
| 0009 | `procure_requests` | `approval_batches`, `approval_requests` | one question, one answer, one channel — chat answers land here (D75–D79) |
| 0010 | `procure_rounds` | `payment_rounds`, `payment_round_lines`, `round_transfers`, `line_settlements` | TRANSFERRED ≠ PAID (D6); a round funds in instalments (D107) |
| 0011 | `procure_po` | `purchase_orders`, `po_lines`, `po_schedule` | terms with a guard, amendment by supersession (D132–D135); deposit earned on issue (F27, D99) |
| 0012 | `procure_receipts` | `receipts` | two documents, a receiver **and** a checker (D101); report and confirmation are separate acts (D131) |
| 0013 | `acct_ledger` | `accounts`, `transaction_types`, `transactions`, `transaction_lines`, `payment_allocations` | the five real accounts seeded; the leadership account is *locked*, not hidden (D87). **No document, no row** (D85); VOID never DELETE. Pulled forward from 0012–0014 because procurement's money views read it — see *Per schema, not per layer* |
| 0014 | `procure_views` | every procurement `v_*` | **Done.** The ladder, coverage, the meeting quadrant, the variance, the round, the PO's two axes with terms and the BLOCKED guard, the vendor journey, purchase facts |
| 0015 | `core_idempotency` | `core.idempotency_keys` | **Done.** `(service, endpoint, key) → response`. `ok`/`noop`/409 stored; 403/422/5xx not — storing a 422 would make a corrected resubmission return the old complaint for ever. Pulled forward from 0027: a seam written without it has to be opened again and threaded through |
| 0016 | `procure_seams` | procurement's write functions | **Done**, for the fifteen that carry a decision: `submit_pr`, `approve_line`, `remove_line`, `note_line`, `explain_variance`, `answer_request`, `approve_po`, `issue_po`, `amend_po_line`, `close_po`, `confirm_receipt`, `approve_round`, `transfer_round`, `merge_vendor`, `curate_vendor`. The creation seams are listed as outstanding in `02-api.md` |
| 0017 | `acct_review` | `evidence_inbox` | five roads, none of them delete (F26, D94) |
| 0018 | `acct_calendar` | `cash_components`, `cash_overrides`, `cash_settlements` | three tables, **no projection stored** — the twelve months are a view (D109–D115) |
| 0019 | `acct_views` + `acct_seams` | `v_transaction`, `v_cash_plan`, `v_inbox_health`; `post_transaction()`, `allocate_payment()`, `resolve_inbox()` | the two money seams (ADR-006) |
| 00xx | `hr_people` | `employees` | `paid_leave_days` per person (D144); nobody is deleted, `left_on` retires |
| 00xx | `hr_attendance` | `attendance_imports`, `attendance_scans`, `day_marks` | one row per **tap** (D141); a mark never overrides a scan (D142); re-upload is a no-op (D143) |
| 00xx | `hr_overtime` | `overtime_sheets`, `overtime_lines` | two kinds of sheet (D146); leadership signs **after** HRD (D145); `form_amount` is the GAJI column of the paper (D154) |
| 00xx | `hr_payroll` | `payroll_runs`, `payroll_adjustments` | payroll lines are **not a table** — they are a view over days and approved overtime (A3); adjustments are typed, signed, reasoned, and frozen once the run leaves DRAFT (D155) |
| 00xx | `prod_master` | `products`, `bom_components` | products are *made*, items are *bought* — different tables (D149); size is three numbers (D150); an unpriced component marks the total incomplete, never zero |
| 00xx | `prod_orders` | `process_stages` (seed), `work_orders` | seven stages as **data** (Q35); late-first ordering is a view, not a column |
| 00xx | `prod_progress` | `progress_entries` | append-only; a correction is a negative entry (A5); signing an overtime sheet posts progress (D147) |
| 00xx | `inv_timber` | `log_purchases`, `log_pieces`, `sawn_boards` | two volumes with a saw between them (D153); the seller's claimed m³ is kept **beside** ours, never replacing it; yield only over logs actually sawn (F46) |

The numbers past `0019` are left open on purpose. Each remaining schema takes
its tables, its views and its seams together, and how many files that is depends
on the schema — HR's payroll view is a migration on its own; inventory's whole
surface is smaller than that.

### Per schema, not per layer

The first cut of this table ended with `0025 views` and `0026 seams`: every view
in the system in one migration, every write function in the next. That is the
horizontal order, and `03-estimate.md` had already argued against it in its own
*Suggested order* — *finish `procure` end to end before starting `acct`; a
vertical slice proves the pattern, four horizontal layers prove nothing until
the last one lands.*

Building it settled the argument. Three things only show up vertically:

- **A view needs tables from the next schema down.** `v_pr_line_status` cannot
  compute coverage without `acct.payment_allocations` and the VOID status of the
  transaction behind it. Written in layer order, procurement's central view
  would have been unrunnable until accounting's tables landed nine migrations
  later — which means unreviewed, and un-smoke-tested, for most of the build.
- **The definition of done is per schema.** "Its schema has a `smoke.sql` that
  proves a refusal and a derivation" cannot be satisfied by a schema whose
  derivations live in a migration that does not exist yet.
- **Idempotency is not a late layer.** `0027` in the first cut; a seam written
  without it has to be opened again and threaded through, and a seam opened
  twice is a seam whose audit and outbox rows get rearranged by somebody who has
  forgotten why they were in that order.

So `0013` (`acct_ledger`) is pulled forward ahead of procurement's views, and
`0016` (idempotency) ahead of its seams. Both are dependencies, not preferences.

## Enums the contracts corrected

`0001` was written against `02-database.md`; the running shape is
`src/services/*/contracts.ts`. Eleven enums had drifted, and every one of them
would have surfaced as a failed insert on the day the matching screen was
swapped — the most expensive moment to find it, because by then the screen, the
view and the seam are all suspects.

| Enum | `0001` said | The contracts say | Why the contracts win |
|---|---|---|---|
| `procure.line_status_t` | 10 values incl. `REQUESTED`, `HOLD`, `REJECTED`, `APPROVED_UNPAID` | 7: `DRAFT`, `WAITING FOR APPROVAL`, `APPROVED`, `PAID`, `PARTIAL`, `COMPLETED`, `REMOVED` | `HELD`/`REJECTED` went in D28, `WAITING FOR PAYMENT` in D126. `APPROVED_UNPAID` and `PAID_UNAPPROVED` were never statuses — they are the meeting quadrant, now its own `meeting_state_t` |
| `procure.channel_t` | `app`, `chat`, `meeting` | `web`, `chat`, `sheet`, `script`, `api` | a meeting is a room, not a channel. What the record must carry is which system authenticated the person who said yes (D69, F16) |
| `procure.receipt_condition_t` | 4 | 7, spaces and all | `PARTIALLY DAMAGED` and `RETURN TO SENDER` are conditions the running system records, and only two of the seven count toward completion (A18) |
| `procure.receipt_status_t` | + `DISPUTED` | `REPORTED`, `CONFIRMED` | a dispute is a *condition* on the receipt. A status as well would give one fact two homes |
| `procure.po_status_t` | + `PARTIAL` | `DRAFT`, `ISSUED`, `CLOSED`, `CANCELLED` | how much has arrived is the other axis, computed and never stored (A1) |
| `procure.item_kind_t` | `material`, `consumable`, `service`, `asset` | `goods`, `service` | the only distinction that changes behaviour is whether anything was ever going to be delivered (D25). The rest is what `item_categories` is for |
| `procure.due_rule_t` | + `days_after_delivery`, `fixed_date` | `on_issue`, `on_delivery`, `date` | two rules nobody wrote a screen for |
| `acct.direction_t` | `in`, `out` | `IN`, `OUT` | it is what the rows say. Lower case fails on the first real insert and on every imported row |
| `acct.trx_status_t` | `DRAFT`, `POSTED`, `VOID`, `INCOMPLETE` | `POSTED`, `COMPLETED`, `UNTRACKED`, `VOID` | no document, no row (D85), so there is no DRAFT. `UNTRACKED` is money that legitimately names no request (D83) |
| `acct.alloc_method_t` | `line`, `order`, `round`, `manual` | `transfer`, `cash`, `other` | those were the allocation's *target*, which `pr_line_no`/`po_no` already carry. Storing it twice is storing a disagreement |
| `acct.inbox_origin_t` / `_status_t` | `upload/chat/email/bank`; no `CANCELLED` | `chat/web`; `CANCELLED` | two doors exist, not four. And withdrawing a document is not the same act as accounting rejecting it — the difference is who to ask about it |
| `prod.work_order_status_t` | + `IN_PROGRESS` | `OPEN`, `DONE`, `CANCELLED` | how far along it is comes from the progress entries (A3) |
| `core.doc_kind_t` | 13 | 14 | `laporan_lembur` was missing; a staff session's own report is a kind the screens already file (D146), and a kind the database cannot store is evidence that lands under `other` |

### Three bugs the smoke found that reading would not have

Worth recording, because each one applies cleanly and fails only when exercised
— which is the argument for a smoke file over a careful review:

- **`amend_po_line` inserted the new line before retiring the old one.** Both
  were live for an instant, both claiming the vendor's line number, and
  `po_lines_live_no_idx` refused it — correctly. The supersession foreign key is
  now `deferrable initially deferred`, so the old row can point at a line that
  does not exist yet; the check still runs before commit, so a dangling pointer
  is impossible and merely allowed to be momentary.
- **A PL/pgSQL variable named `covered` shadowed a column of that name.**
  Postgres refuses the query rather than guessing, at run time.
- **`text[] || 'a literal'`** resolves to array-concatenation, not
  element-append, and fails when the branch is finally reached — which for a
  close-blocker message is the first time an order is genuinely unclosable.

Two more corrections, both found the same way:

- **`0006` seeded nothing.** `items.base_uom` and `items.category_code` are
  foreign keys, so a schema with no `uom` and no `item_categories` rows is one
  that accepts no items at all. The eighteen units, four conversions and ten
  categories are now in the migration.
- **`00_shim.sql` used `create if not exists` and `rebuild.sh` never dropped
  `auth`.** So an edit to the shim did nothing on a cluster that had already run
  once, which made the shim the single part of the ladder that only worked
  against yesterday's database — the exact failure `rebuild.sh` exists to
  prevent. It drops and recreates its own schema now.

## The derivations — the real work of Phase 2

Phase 1 computes on read, in TypeScript. **2.583 lines** of it:

| File | Lines | What moves where |
|---|---|---|
| `src/demo/derive.ts` | 1.588 | line status, PR coverage, round summaries, PO journeys, vendor journeys, ledger allocations, the cash plan, inbox health → `v_pr_line_status`, `v_po_line_status`, `v_round_summary`, `v_vendor_journey`, `v_cash_plan`, `v_inbox_health` |
| `src/demo/hr-derive.ts` | 533 | the six slots from taps, day state and `day_value`, the payroll line, the payslip week, lateness → `v_timesheet_day`, `v_payroll_line`, `v_payslip_day` |
| `src/demo/production-derive.ts` | 275 | stage progress, work-order state, BOM material cost → `v_work_order`, `v_bom_cost` |
| `src/demo/inventory-derive.ts` | 187 | log m³ by convention, yield over sawn logs only, Rp/m³ per vendor **per species** → `v_log_purchase`, `v_timber_vendor` |

Two rules for the port, both learned the hard way in Phase 1:

- **A view may return a missing figure. It may not return a wrong one.** Where
  the demo marks a total *belum lengkap* (an unpriced BOM component, a partly
  sawn load), the view returns `null` plus a count — never a silent zero.
- **Port the test with the logic.** Each derivation view gets rows in
  `smoke.sql` that reproduce a number this project already argued about: Kayu
  Manis at Rp 34,6 juta/m³ papan (F46), Karjo's 1,5 paid days out of five days
  with hours on them (F48), a round marked TRANSFERRED that is still not PAID.

## Seeds

| Seed | Source of truth | Why it is a seed and not a form |
|---|---|---|
| `core.permission_catalog` | `src/lib/roles.ts` | adding a verb should be a reviewable diff, not a row somebody types (D24) |
| `core.doc_prefixes`, `core.doc_kind_labels` | `src/services/documents/contracts.ts` | the label a screen prints, beside the code the database stores |
| `acct.accounts` | the five real accounts | PETTY CASH · BNI 325 · BCA 271 · JAGO · BCA 064 (D87) |
| `acct.transaction_types` | the running system, `EJO` included | carried verbatim and unclassified, never folded into OTHERS (Q10) |
| `procure.uom` + conversions | `src/demo/fixtures/reference.ts` | including the log→board yield, which is a different kind of number from a factor |
| `prod.process_stages` | seven stages | data, so reordering is a seed diff (Q35) |

## Contract changes the schema forces

The build session appends here; the design session applies them to
`src/services/*/contracts.ts` in its own commit (see the protocol in
`README.md`).

| # | Contract today | Schema | Why the schema wins |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `DocKind` is a display string: `"Receipt / Invoice / Nota"` | `core.doc_kind_t` is a code: `nota` | a stored value should not change when somebody rewords a label. `core.doc_kind_labels` holds the wording, and the UI reads it from there |
| C2 | ids are readable strings (`emp_04`, `lbr_03`) | `uuid` | the demo's ids are for humans reading fixtures. The swap is mechanical; nothing outside `src/demo` depends on their shape |
| C3 | `ModuleGrant[]` on the session | `core.user_modules` rows + `v_my_access` | the permission list stays **derived** on read, not stored (A3) |
| C4 | `AttendanceScan.import_id` optional | `hr.attendance_imports.id`, NOT NULL for `source='import'` | a tap that came from a file should always name the file, or a re-upload cannot be proved to be a no-op (D143) |

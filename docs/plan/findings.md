# Findings — what building the workflow taught us

**This file is the deliverable of Phase 1, as much as the app is.**

The premise of the whole plan is that the business rules were never specified
up front, and that you find them by walking a working screen rather than by
designing a schema. This is where what we find gets written down. On D14 it
is consolidated, and `02-database.md` is rewritten against it.

Append one entry per session. Never edit an old entry — if a finding turns out
to be wrong, add a new entry saying so.

## Entry format

```
## D4 · 2026-09-13 · M4 PR list and create

**What the screen could not answer.**
…a question a real user asked that the data does not hold.

**What we assumed.**
…the default taken, and from where (06-decisions Qn, or new).

**What this implies for the schema.**
…the field, table, state or rule that turns out to be needed.

**What surprised us.**
…anything that contradicts a document or an assumption.
```

Keep entries short. Four lines each is fine. What matters is that they exist
and that nothing gets remembered only in a chat log.

## F1 · 2026-09-10 · before any code — the direction of evidence

**What the owner said.** Today: upload to Google Chat, then review on the
web. "That's really hard to trace between the existing data because it's
unordered." Instead: accounting attaches documents **directly from the PR, or
from the ledger**. A context-free upload is only for the case where there is
no PR — bought first, approved later. Google Chat becomes notification,
confirmation, and the interface for people outside web access. A reader bot
already exists; integration is later.

**Why "unordered" is the right word.** In the current model every document is
an orphan looking for a parent. The extraction guesses a vendor and an amount,
and a person reconstructs the linkage afterwards from name similarity and
amount proximity. Nothing records *who decided* that this receipt belongs to
that line — only that someone once picked it off a list. That is what makes
it untraceable, and it is not fixed by improving the guess.

**What this implies for the schema.**

- `core.attachment_links` moves from a convenience to **the main road**, and
  many-to-many stops being a workaround for unnameable files.
- Every link row must carry **who declared it and when**. That single column
  is the answer to the tracing problem.
- The review queue shrinks to `acct.evidence_inbox` and loses everything that
  existed to support the guess: slot naming, the capped candidate picker, the
  always-offer-the-selected-line rule, `duplicate_of_event`.
- It gains `origin` (`chat` | `web`) and a health view, because the size of
  the exception road is now a signal about the health of the normal one.
- A new resolution appears that the old model had no name for: **a retroactive
  PR line**. Purchase-first-approval-later has a legitimate shape, and giving
  it one keeps it out of the off-PR bucket.

**Two of the four questions dissolve; two are real.** "Which PR?" and "is this
supporting an existing transaction?" are answered by construction once the
person attaches from the parent. "One document, many transactions" and "one PR
line, many transactions" survive — the first becomes an explicit *also
covers…* action, the second was already the allocation model.

**What surprised us.** The AI's job gets smaller and safer. On the main road
the vendor, the expected amount and the parent are already known, so
extraction stops classifying and starts **verifying** — and a disagreement
becomes an advisory warning rather than something a human has to adjudicate
before anything can be recorded.

**Assumptions taken** (see `06-decisions.md`): the exception upload arrives
from Chat *and* the web and lands in the same inbox (Q-none, inferred — the
buyer without web access is precisely the exception case); Chat approvals
cover goods and receiving but not fund decisions (Q16); attaching a payment
proof to a line with no transaction offers to post one in the same panel
(Q14).

-- 0010_procure_rounds.sql — a payment round: the batch of approved lines that
-- leadership funds, and the instalments that fund it.
--
-- One rule shapes this whole file, and it is the one `john-lau` got wrong most
-- expensively: **TRANSFERRED is not PAID** (D6, A10). Money arriving in the
-- paying account is money arriving in the paying account. It does not pay a
-- vendor, it does not settle a line, and it is not even reserved for the lines
-- in this round — cash is fungible, so money moved in for last week's approvals
-- is spent on whatever gets paid first (D126).
--
-- So the round's status ladder says what happened to the ROUND, and what
-- happened to a LINE is computed from the allocations against it, in
-- `v_pr_line_status`. Two different questions; the old system had one column
-- for both and it was wrong for one of them at all times.

 *  other way: **timber is bought as logs and used as boards**, and those are
 *  two different quantities of two different materials with a saw in between
 *  (D153).
 *
 *  A log is priced per cubic metre of round wood. What the workshop can
 *  actually put in a table is the sawn volume, which is always less — the
 *  sawdust, the slabs off the sides, the split that ran down the middle. So
 *  the cost of a cubic metre of *usable* board is never the price on the
 *  vendor's invoice, and a business that compares vendors on the invoice price
 *  is comparing the wrong number.
 *
 *  Everything here exists to make that one comparison honest: cubic metres in,
 *  cubic metres out, rupiah per usable cubic metre, per purchase and per
 *  vendor.
 */

/** How a log's volume was arrived at.
 *
 *  Two methods are in use in this trade and they do not agree, so the record
 *  says which one produced the number rather than leaving it to be inferred
 *  (Q39):
 *
 *  - `round` — the geometric volume of a cylinder, π/4 × d² × L. What the log
 *    actually contains.
 *  - `square` — the *kubikasi persegi* the trade quotes in: the largest square
 *    beam the log could yield, d² × L, which is smaller and is what many
 *    sellers price against.

/* ── The nota, and why it must be recognised before it is parsed ──────────
 *
 *  The ordinary flow is the other way round from what a tidy system would
 *  want: **the transaction is recorded first**, and the nota is attached to it
 *  afterwards (owner). For almost every nota that is fine — the lines on the
 *  paper are the things bought, and one line is one thing.
 *
 *  A **nota kayu is not shaped like that.** It lists thirty rows of board
 *  sizes, and every one of them is a size, not a purchase. Parse it the way
 *  every other nota is parsed and the ledger gains thirty transaction lines
 *  for one load of wood, the spend report doubles, and somebody spends an
 *  afternoon working out why.
 *
 *  So a timber nota has to be **recognised before it is read**, and what
 *  follows from recognition is a routing decision: its total is one figure for
 *  accounting, and its rows are boards for inventory. Same document, two
 *  readers, one number each (D200).

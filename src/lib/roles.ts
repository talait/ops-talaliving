/** The access catalogue.
 *
 *  Access is TWO things, and conflating them is the bug this model exists to
 *  avoid (D24):
 *
 *  1. **Module grants** — which screens open, and how far you can go inside
 *     them. A user holds several: procurement + accounting + HR is normal
 *     (D23). Levels are `read` < `write` < `admin`.
 *
 *  2. **Authorities** — the handful of named decisions. Granted on their own,
 *     never implied by a module level. `approve_goods` belongs to the CEO
 *     alone (D19) whether or not anyone else can open Procurement.
 *
 *  Why they are separate: in `john-lau` the confirm button showed for anyone
 *  with `finance`, `director` or `it_admin`, and the bridge then refused it
 *  based on an environment variable the screen could not read. The user saw an
 *  enabled button and got a 403. Here the screen and the guard read the same
 *  grant.
 *
 *  This file is the SEED SOURCE, deliberately in code rather than as rows a
 *  human types: a fresh database can be bootstrapped without anyone guessing
 *  what should exist, and adding a module shows up as a reviewable diff. In
 *  Phase 2 it generates the migration; the database is what enforces.

 *  It is **stated, not enforced by a flag on the user**, and that is a choice:
 *  the only honest way to enforce it would be to decide in code who counts as
 *  leadership, and the two candidates for deriving that — holding
 *  `approve_funds` or `approve_goods` — are exactly what D24 forbids. A
 *  stand-in appointed to approve payments for a week would silently gain the
 *  right to read everyone's activity log. So the grant remains the only door,
 *  and this sentence sits beside it where the grant is made.
 *
 *  What *is* enforced is the verb the owner used: **baca**. Leadership holds
 *  `it: read` and administration stays at `admin` — see `requireLevel`.

-- 0009_procure_requests.sql — asking for an approval through a channel that
-- knows who answers.
--
-- The problem this exists for is in `0008`'s comment on `recorded_by_email`, and
-- this is the machinery that solves it. A leadership meeting runs on whoever's
-- laptop is open. If procurement ticks the box while the CEO says yes across
-- the table, the record says procurement approved it — false, in the one place
-- the system is supposed to be trustworthy.
--
-- So **the yes leaves the room.** The line is sent to the approver in Google
-- Chat, they answer there, and the identity on the record comes from the chat
-- platform's own authentication rather than from whoever is logged in here
-- (D69). The metadata then reads what actually happened:
-- `chat · evin@talaliving.com · 14:00`.

-- One send: a list, a total, and one answer session — because that is how a
-- meeting works (D70). A card per line would ask the approver to add up fifteen
-- numbers in their head to know what they have just committed the company to.

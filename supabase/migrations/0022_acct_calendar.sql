-- 0022_acct_calendar.sql — twelve months, planned against actual.
--
-- Three tables and **no projection stored** (D109–D115). The twelve months are
-- computed on every read, from the lines somebody typed, the months somebody
-- changed, and the ledger as it stands. A stored projection is one that
-- disagrees with the ledger the moment a payment lands.
--
-- The hard part is not the arithmetic, it is the **claiming**. A ledger row may
-- only be counted once, and which planned line gets it depends on how specific
-- that line is: a dated one-off takes its own payment before the standing line
-- for that category sweeps it up (D110). Without that order, *pelunasan kartu
-- kredit* in November is swallowed by the monthly card bill and the plan shows
-- the routine amount twice.
--
-- Claiming in order is sequential by nature, so the engine is a set-returning
-- function rather than a plain view. It is still **computed on read** — A3 is
-- about not storing a derived figure, not about which language derives it.

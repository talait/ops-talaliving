/** The drafting queue as it stands on a Friday (D179).
 *
 *  Five situations, because a queue where everything is fine teaches nobody how
 *  to read it:
 *
 *  - **Late and undrawn.** The rak display is on a work order due 15 September
 *    and nobody has started its gambar kerja.
 *  - **Blocked on an answer.** The pintu panel is drawn and cannot be released:
 *    nobody has confirmed whether the client wants a 40 mm or 45 mm leaf, and
 *    the question has been waiting nine days.
 *  - **Ahead of release.** The lemari's revision C exists and was never
 *    released, so the workshop is still cutting from B. This is the dangerous
 *    one — everything looks done.
 *  - **Ordered, not yet on the floor.** The nakas was ordered by VILLA
 *    SEMINYAK; there is no SPK yet, and its gambar jadi has never been made.
 *  - **Finished properly.** The meja makan: revision B released, nothing open.

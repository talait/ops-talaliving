 *  Rule 9 of the Phase 2 brief: secrets come from the environment, never the
 *  repo, and `service_role` never appears in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` name. That rule
 *  is easy to agree with and easy to break by accident — somebody adds the
 *  prefix to make an import work, the build succeeds, and a key that bypasses
 *  every row-level policy in the database ships inside a JavaScript bundle that
 *  anybody can read.
 *
 *  So it is checked here, at the one place the keys are read, and the check
 *  throws rather than warns. A build that fails is a bad afternoon; a service
 *  key in a bundle is a bad year.

 *  whole swap — with one function missing on purpose.
 *
 *  **`actAs` is gone.** In the demo it switches which person is acting so that
 *  permissions can be shown working rather than described; against a real
 *  database it would be an endpoint that lets anybody become anybody, which is
 *  not a feature with a guard missing, it is the absence of authentication. Who
 *  is acting now comes from Supabase Auth and from nowhere else. The persona
 *  picker keeps working in demo mode, where there is nothing to impersonate.

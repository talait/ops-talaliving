/** Declaring an order finished.
 *
 *  Refused while either axis disagrees — money and goods are never collapsed
 *  (A1) — and refused while nothing is filed against it. A written reason is
 *  the way past that, because real orders end untidily: the last two sheets
 *  were never delivered and nobody is going to chase them. What is not
 *  acceptable is an order that quietly closes as if it had finished cleanly,
 *  which is why the reason is kept on the audit row (D130).

# Find PL/pgSQL locals that share a name with a column somewhere in the schema.
#
# Written after the fifth instance. `declare covered numeric;` in a function
# that later says `select covered from procure.v_line_coverage` is ambiguous,
# and Postgres refuses the query rather than guessing — correctly, and **at run
# time**. The migration applies, the function is created, and the failure waits
# until the one branch that happens to reach that line.
#
# Five of those in one session is not five mistakes, it is a missing check. So:
#
#   supabase/local/check_shadowing.sh
#   PGHOST=/tmp PGPORT=5433 supabase/local/check_shadowing.sh
#
# The convention it enforces is the cheap one — **prefix every local with
# `v_`** (and every argument with `p_`, which the seams already do). Parameters
# are exempt because `p_` already puts them out of reach of any column name.
#
# It reads the migration files rather than the catalogue, because what it needs
# is the `declare` block as written, and `pg_get_functiondef` gives that back
# only after the parser has already accepted it.

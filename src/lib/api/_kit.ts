/** Shared machinery for the real services.
 *
 *  The twin of `src/demo/api/_kit.ts`, and deliberately the same shape: the
 *  screens handle one envelope, so both implementations have to produce it. The
 *  difference is where the refusal comes from. In the demo a function checks an
 *  array and decides; here the **database** decides, and this file's only job is
 *  to carry its answer across without inventing anything.
 *
 *  Three kinds of answer arrive, and all three land on `Result<T>`:
 *
 *  1. **A seam's envelope.** Every `security definer` function in the ladder
 *     returns `{outcome, status, data, error}` — built by `core.say()` in
 *     `0003_core_audit.sql`. Rule 4: refusals are values, not exceptions. It is
 *     already the right shape; `fromSeam` unwraps it.
 *  2. **A PostgREST error.** A select that RLS refused, a unique index that
 *     fired, a check constraint. These arrive as `PostgrestError` and are
 *     mapped below, by SQLSTATE.
 *  3. **Rows.** A view answered. `fromRows` wraps them.
